            I would describe myself as a creative person with a lot of willpower
            when something gets <i>'entre ceja y ceja'</i>, as we say in
            Spanish. I enjoy <b>traveling</b> (whether with friends or solo),
            <b>painting</b>, and <b>roller skating</b>, and I love sharing these
            activities with people who have similar interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy <b>programming</b> and have been working as a software
            engineer for the past two years at a startup, where I‚Äôve been
            learning a lot. <br />

        <h3>My journey</h3>
        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            I am currently <b>living in Karlsruhe</b>, Germany. How did I end up
            here, you may ask?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, let me take you back to 2017, when I finished my
            <b>Classical Music degree in Barcelona</b>. It‚Äôs very common for
            music students to pursue a master's degree abroad, and the
            University of Music Karlsruhe was recommended to me by a dear
            professor. That‚Äôs how I decided to audition there.
          </p>
          <p>
            In September 2017, I enrolled at the
            <a href="https://hfm-karlsruhe.de/" target="_blank"
              >Hochschule f√ºr Musik Karlsruhe</a
            >, performing my final piano recital and obtaining my
            <b>Master‚Äôs diploma in February 2020.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            During the pandemic, I stayed in Germany,
            <b>working as a music and language teacher</b>. After finishing my
            studies (and given the global situation ü¶†), I had a lot of time on
            my hands, so I decided to explore other interests. I realized that
            many people around the world were interested in learning Catalan, so
            I started offering online lessons to teach them my mother tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the next year creating content on Instagram and YouTube for
            my students, working as a freelancer, and earning a
            <b>specialization degree in second language teaching</b> from the
            <a href="https://www.uvic.cat/en">University of Vic</a> .
          </p>
          <p>
            My small online teaching business introduced me to the world of
            programming. While building a website for my students, I became
            familiar with <b>HTML and CSS</b>, and I quickly realized that this
            could become a fulfilling career if I dedicated enough time and
            resources to it. In March 2022, I applied to a remote
            <b>Web Development Bootcamp</b> offered by
            <a href="https://www.spiced-academy.com/en" target="_blank"
              >Spiced Academy</a
            >, and three months after graduating, I began my professional
            journey at a startup.

        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            For the past year and 10 months, I have been working as a Software
            Engineer at <a href="https://ledgy.com/">Ledgy AG</a>, a startup
            that offers
            <b>equity management solutions to companies and their employees</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the first six months, I worked as a trainee, learning to
            efficiently use development tools such as
            <b>Git, Jira</b> , and <b>VSCode</b>. I also learned
            <b>TypeScript</b> and how to work with <b>MongoDB</b>, while
            familiarizing myself with the product and its complex,
            <b>equity-related concepts</b>. Most importantly, I gained valuable
            experience in collaborating as part of a
            <b>team consisting of designers, product managers, and developers</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            After becoming a junior engineer, I joined a team focused on
            automating workflows like
            <b>document handling, templating, and account configurations</b>. I
            worked on <b>both front-end and backend tasks</b>, so I got to do a
            bit of everything. Our team played a key role in delivering features
            and creating smooth demo flows for clients, which was really
            rewarding.

          After living in Germany for seven years, I feel the need to return
          home and be close to my family and old friends. I would love to be in
          Barcelona again and enjoy her sunny streets. Therefore,
          <b>I am open to relocating to Spain</b> if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also looking forward to my next trip to Colombia, which will take
          place in November 2024.
