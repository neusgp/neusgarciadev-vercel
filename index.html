            Hi! Hold on a moment, I’m going to tell you a bit about myself. I
            think it’s super important to share my passions with you — like
            traveling, skating with my friends, painting (mostly with
            watercolors), singing, and as if that weren’t enough, playing the
            piano too.
          </p>
          <p>So many things, right? Lately, I’ve been working at a
            <a href="https://ledgy.com/" target="_blank">startup</a> and I love
            programming. All these activities make me a pretty well-rounded
            person and add a creative touch to my more technical side. I’m the
            kind of person who goes all in, and in the case of programming, it
            was a big discovery — and it never stops fascinating me.

    <h4>My journey</h4>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        My story feels like a rollercoaster, with its twists and turns, ups
        and downs — but that’s life, and that’s how it’s meant to be, right?
        In 2017, I moved to Germany, and honestly, I haven’t stopped doing
        things since I arrived. Alongside my master’s studies at the
        <a href="https://hfm-karlsruhe.de/" target="_blank">Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe</a>, I worked as a piano
        and language teacher, and with the same
        energy I poured into that, I dove headfirst into the world of code —
        from user experience and interface design, to websites and
        functionality, all the way through to development. Getting a bit
        more technical now, here’s a list of some tools I enjoy using:
      </p>
      <p class="stack">
        figma · notion · git · html · css · wordpress · javascript · typescript · react
      </p>

  <div id="friends" class="section">
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        Living abroad isn’t easy, and I’ve often missed my homeland,
        Catalonia. There’s a very important reason why I decided to stay in
        Karlsruhe: my friends. I believe in personal relationships — without
        them, it’s impossible to grow as an individual. I initially came
        here because of my love for music, but when I considered returning
        to Barcelona, I chose to stay for them and to continue growing
        professionally in Germany.

        Right now, I’m looking for a job and I’m eager to apply all my
        knowledge and skills. That’s why I feel ready to take on any role:
        as an individual contributor, leading a team, teaching and
        mentoring, or working across disciplines to connect different teams
        or departments — always with the goal of improving the company with
        joy. Whatever it is, I bring passion and proactivity.
